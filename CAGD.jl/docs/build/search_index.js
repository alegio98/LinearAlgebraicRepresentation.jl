A face is an element of the PL boundary of a cell, that satisfy a boundary compatibility condition. Two p-cells alpha beta are boundary-compatible when their point-set intersection contains the same r-faces (0leq rleq p) of alpha and beta. A cellular p-complex is regular when each r-cell is face of a p-cell.
